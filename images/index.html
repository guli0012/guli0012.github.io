        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi guys, my name is Gulifeila Alimujiang, I am a new IMD student,
        I am full of curiosty and interest in this aspect,and I am studing hard.
        I hope I can do my favorite job after graduation and be happy every day.</p>
        <p>Besides programming, I also like watching movies and traveling.
         Watching movies can amuse me and I can learn something interesting
          from them, while traveling can make me know the world better. 
          One of my favorite movies is Inception, it makes my imagination rich. 
          I believe that continuous learning and exploration is the best way
           to improve myself.</p>
